# Etheron Remote Access Platform 
Production-ready remote access platform with screen sharing, recording, and subscription management.

Etheron stands for boundary-less connectivity.
It reflects the idea that no matter where users are — across cities, countries, or continents — their devices, desktops, and workflows stay connected in a single, unified space.

Just like “ether” fills everything, Etheron fills every gap between users and their remote systems.
